# Reactive Quarkus Workshop - Mutiny - Lab

This repository includes the lab assignment on _Mutiny_.

## Getting started

You'll be working on a couple of unit tests to get a better understanding of the in and outs of the Mutiny data types. Everything you need is in the code in this repository, there are no external dependencies.

Vert.x is already integrated in this project, as this will be the base for the next lab as well - ignore that for the time being!

The assignment is described in `ASSIGNMENT.md`. If you're stuck, there are hints available in `HINTS.md`.
