# Reactive Quarkus Workshop - Vert.x - Lab

This repository includes the lab assignment on _Vert.x_.

## Getting started

You'll be working on a couple of unit tests to get a better understanding of Vert.x. Everything you need is in the code in this repository, there are no external dependencies.

Vert.x with Mutiny is already integrated in this project, so you can directly go to the assignments.

The assignment is described in `ASSIGNMENT.md`. If you're stuck, there are hints available in `HINTS.md`.
